# Screenshotbot: Screenshot Testing Service

[![Build Status](http://jenkins.tdrhq.com/buildStatus/icon?job=screenshotbot-oss)](http://jenkins.tdrhq.com/job/screenshotbot-oss/)

Screenshotbot is a Open-source Visual Testing platform. Screenshotbot can
connect with your existing Android, iOS or Selenium tests to track how
screenshots change over time, notifying you on Pull Requests, Jira
etc. We provide several integrations to common Code Review and Task
Management platforms, and have more in the pipeline.

Screenshotbot provides an Open Source alternative to various other
tools already on the market (for example, Applitools, Percy,
Happo). It powers our own commercial platform
[screenshotbot.io](https://screenshotbot.io).

Unlike the other tools mentioned, this open source library does not
provide browser test runner. There are better open source tools to run
Selenium or Cypress tests and generate screenshots. Screenshotbot just
expects you to use these tools to generate a directory of screenshots,
and we'll handle the rest.

## Quick installation with Docker

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

If you need to modify the `config.lisp`, modify it before running this
command. In the future we'll provide live reloading of config.lisp for
docker, but at the moment that's only available when not using docker.

## More complicated Installation

Screenshotbot is written in Common Lisp. Common Lisp has several
commercial and open source implementations. We officially support
SBCL, Clozure CL (CCL) and LispWorks, but the core features should work on
any compliant Common Lisp.

Certain features, such as the Slack integration, use third-party Java
libraries. Java is not supported in SBCL, so if you need these
integrations you should use either CCL or LispWorks. The integrations
that we're still porting to OSS, mostly rely on Java, so if you want
to be safe pick CCL.

LispWorks is a commercial platform, and can get expensive. Contact us
if you need pre-built binaries on LispWorks, but it'll come with
additional licensing restrictions. SBCL is more performant that CCL,
but we think CCL should satisfy your needs if you do need Java
support. [screenshotbot.io](https://screenshotbot.io) is powered by
LispWorks.

### OS

Currently we primarily support Linux.

In theory we should be able to work on Mac (easy) and Windows
(harder). If you do go this route, you're on your own. But please send
us pull requests :)

### Dependencies

Screenshotbot is built as a monolith service. It does not depend on
any external service. It does not use an external database. There are
a few command line tools (`imagemagic` and `html2text`) that we use,
and we'll automatically pull in an Common Lisp dependencies with
Quicklisp.

### Launch

Once you've picked your implementation, you can use the implementation
to load launch.lisp. For example, with CCL that looks like:

```
 $ path/to/ccl/lx86cl64 -l launch.lisp
```

On SBCL:


```
$ sbcl --script launch.lisp
```

This should start up Screenshotbot on port 4091. You can access it as
http://localhost:4091 from the browser. All the data will be stored in
`~/.config/screenshotbot/object-store`. If you need to reset the
state, you can just delete that directory and start over. But you must
treat this directory as your database. We recommend keeping this on a
device with high redundancy, such as RAID or Amazon EBS.

This might be a good time to put Screenshotbot [behind an
Nginx](https://github.com/screenshotbot/screenshotbot-oss/wiki/Configuring-Nginx)
or Apache reverse-proxy, and enable HTTPS. (We highly recommend using
Certbot for free certificates).

### Setting up java location

By default we look for `libjvm.so` at
`/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/lib/server/libjvm.so`. For most
Linux distributions except for Debian, this would be incorrect. You
can configure this by passing the `--libjvm` command line argument.

In the future, we'll do better at guessing locations of libjvm for
different distributions.

### Configuration

Screenshotbot has integrations with various external tools,
e.g. GitHub, Jira, SSO etc. Most of these platforms require some
kind of API key to access their APIs, and must be configured with
Screenshotbot before you can use them.

For simplicity and maintainability, we don't have complex GUIs to
modify these _site-admin_ configurations. Instead each of these
integrations are exposed as plugins that must be configured with basic
Common Lisp code. The configuration can be hot-reloaded.

Screenshotbot looks for a file called `config.lisp` in both the
git-root, and in `~/.config/screenshotbot/`. If found, it loads this
file as the configuration.

See [Updating
config.lisp](https://github.com/screenshotbot/screenshotbot-oss/wiki/Updating-config.lisp)
for a more thorough discussion.

### Becoming a Site-Admin

After installing Screenshotbot, we recommend setting up one user as a
site-admin. The site-admin gets special administrative powers that
will be required for hot-reloading config files, and hot-reloading
updates. We might also build more configuration powers for site-admins
in the future.

After signing up and logging in, go to
`https://<domain>/site-admin/self-promotion`. Follow the steps. You'll
need shell access to the directory with the Screenshotbot
installation. You'll now have access to an Admin menu on the bottom
left.


## Calling Screenshotbot from your CI jobs

First, you'll need to generate an API key inside Screenshotbot. You'll
use this to access the API or the CLI tools.

Next you need to build the CLI tool for your platform. Common Lisp is
a compiled language, so in general you'll need different binaries for
different platforms (Linux, Mac or Windows; Intel vs ARM). You can
download pre-built binaries for Linux and Mac from
https://screenshotbot.io/recorder.sh.

(As an alternative, Armed Bear Common Lisp, is a specific
implementation of Common Lisp that can generate platform independent
JAR files from Common Lisp code. We will officially support ABCL in a
future release)

To create a binary on a specific platform, call the script
`build-cli.lisp`. For instance, if you're using SBCL to build the CLI,
it will look like:

```
 $ sbcl --script build-cli.lisp
```

This will generate a screenshotbot-cli executable script. Copy it to a
location from which it can be dowloading during your CI runs, or check
it in to your repository. (As of this writing SBCL generates a binary
that is 105MB in size, and 24MB zipped; CCL 100MB/21MB excluding core;
LispWorks 25MB/4.4MB. LispWorks has extra features to remove unused
code.)

For an example use of this executable see:
https://github.com/tdrhq/fast-example/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml.
You'll also have to pass the `--hostname` argument, which will be the
URL of your Screenshotbot installation.

## Setting up SSO

Screenshotbot comes with an in-built email/password authentication
system, and also supports OpenID Connect out of the box. For more
complex setups, or for fine-grained user management tools or access
logs, we recommend using [Keycloak](www.keycloak.org) (open source) as
an intermediate identity management solution, and connect to Keycloak
with OpenID Connect. You could also use commercial services such as
Amazon Cognito, but we test our solutions against Keycloak.

See [Configuring
SSO](https://github.com/screenshotbot/screenshotbot-oss/wiki/Configuring-SSO)
for a thorough discussion.


## Feature Status

Not all the features on [screenshotbot.io](https://screenshotbot.io)

Footnotes:

1. Not supported because SBCL doesn't support Java

2. Annotations allow you to create tasks directly from Screenshotbot

## Upgrading

In most cases, upgrading will be done via hot-reloading. As a
site-admin, you can `git pull` on the repository, on the shell, go to
go `https://<domain>/admin` and hit `Reload`. This will bring the new
code live without any downtime.

Small catch: Our database is stored is in-memory (with transactions
logged to disk for recovery). Hot-reloading code can force schema
changes. For instance, if a field is deleted between two major
versions, hot reloading will cause that field to be lost forever (but
there are snapshots of old versions of the database for recovery). In
general we'll try to guarantee that between minor versions, on
released commits, as long as you're upgrading (as opposed to
downgrading), we'll be able to auto-migrate any schema cleanly.

You can also upgrade by killing the Lisp process and restarting it. If
you do so, we recommend hitting `Snapshot` on the admin menu before
killing the Lisp process. However killing the Lisp process can cause a
minor downtime. You can work around this by using a tool called
`socketmaster`, but the description of that tool is beyond the scope
of this document.

## Contributing

We welcome Pull Requests!

Keep in mind, we'll do the code review on GitHub, but we'll merge it
via our internal Phabricator instance. The source of truth for the
code is in our internal mono-repo, which is copied over to the OSS
code via Copybara, similar to the process that Google and Facebook
use. We have open sourced many other projects where the source of
truth is GitHub, but Screenshotbot is an actively-developed complex
application that makes this difficult.

We might reject large new features if we think it adds too much
maintenance overhead for us. Bug-fixes are always welcome.
